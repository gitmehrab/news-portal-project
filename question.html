    <h3>Qs.1 : Whats Difference Between var, let , const?</h3>
    <h4>Ans:</h4>
    <p>let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

        Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.</p>
    <p>var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

        Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.</p>
    <p>const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.

        Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables  just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>  
    
    <h3>Qs.2 : Whats Difference Between Regular Function & Arrow Function</h3>
    <h4>Ans:</h4>
    <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
    <h3>Qs.3 : Why use Template String</h3>
    <h4>Ans:</h4>
    <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</p>
